    "The examples given above define vector spaces as sets on which some constraints are imposed. This is fine, but defining a vector space this way (a) require us to verify somewhat tediously that the set does in fact meet the requirements to be a vector space, and (b) doesn't provide much insight into what the vector space really looks like. Another way to specify a vector space is by defining it as the span of a set of vectors: given vectors $\\mathbf{v}_1,\\dots,\\mathbf{v}_k$, the set $V=span(\\mathbf{v}_1,\\dots,\\mathbf{v}_k)$ is by definition the set of all possible linear combinations of $\\mathbf{v}_1,\\dots,\\mathbf{v}_k$, and therefore is necessarily closed under linear combination.
